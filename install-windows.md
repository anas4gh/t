## Using the USB drive to Install Windows 10

> **MAKE SURE YOU BACK UP ALL FILES ON THE PC BEFORE YOU CONTINUE!!**

> This tutorial assumes that you have an empty PC, or that you want to completely wipe the PC and start over!

First of all, turn off the PC, then plug the USB drive into it, then make sure your PC can boot from the USB drive (If your PC **doesn't** have an operating system yet, you probably don't have to worry about this.).

Every computer is different in booting to a USB drive, but on most PCs, you just need to keep pressing <kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>Delete</kbd> as soon as you turn on your PC until it boots into the BIOS, then move your USB drive to the top of the boot drive list, then restart the PC (make sure to undo your changes once you install Windows).

If you've done it correctly, you'll be greeted by the Windows 10 installer.

1. Choose the language, time & currency, and the keyboard language for the operating system you're installing, then press **Next**.
2. Press **Install now**. After that, it will ask you to enter a product key. If you do not want to activate Windows, select **I don't have a product key** at the bottom of the window.
3. Choose the edition you want to install (if you did not enter a product key), then press **Next**.
4. **Accept** the Microsoft Software License Terms, then select the **Custom** installation.
> **WARNING:** Step 5 will delete **ALL** files on your machine! If you have any important data, make sure to back it up.
5. Select every partition and delete it until you have one **Unallocated Space** partition only, then press **New**, then enter the amount of storage you want to allocate to the main Windows drive (or leave it as-is to utilize all the space) and then press **Apply**, then **Next** to start installing Windows.

Once Windows 10 finishes installing, it will restart automatically.

You can now remove your USB drive safely, and start using Windows 10.
